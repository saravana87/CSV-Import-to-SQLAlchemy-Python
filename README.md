# CSV-Import-to-SQLAlchemy-Python
It's just a mini project trying to understand the SQLAlchemy database, Python Flask
It build on Python 3.7.2

Installing modules

pip install sqlalchemy

pip install flask

Steps
1. Add your CSV data in the textbox
2. Click submit. It lets you update the SQLAlchemy data type for each and every field
3. If you want to automatically import to SQLAlchemy database just select NO in the drop down box
4. After seeing successfully imported message. Check Browse link to see the tables and data.

It's very simple. I will try to improvise in future.
